This leads to the usage of small time steps to maintain accuracy requirements, thereby increasing the overall computational time. This paper proposes some remedies to OS techniques that can restore consistency in the coupling of the nonlinear terms and explores high-order mono-block nonlinearly consistent techniques with time step control. The performance of the methods was studied for several transient scenarios using a 0D point-kinetics/thermal-hydraulics lumped model and a 1D neutronics/heat conduction/enthalpy balance model. The results prove that consistent approximations can be made to enhance the overall accuracy in conventional codes with simple nonintrusive techniques. Additionally, an analysis of a mono-block coupling strategy (without having recourse to an OS strategy) is carried out to assess automated time stepping control using higher order Implicit Runge{\textendash}Kutta (IRK) schemes. The conclusions from these results indicate that nonlinearly consistent adaptive time stepping methods can provide better accuracy and reliability in the solution fields than constant time stepping methods, even for transients with rapid and discontinuous variations.},

	abstract = {This research project provides separate effects tests in order to benchmark neutron kinetics models coupled with thermal-hydraulic (T/H) models used in best-estimate codes such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) RELAP and TRAC code series and industrial codes such as RETRAN. Before this research project was initiated, no adequate experimental data existed for reactivity initiated transients that could be used to assess coupled three-dimensional (3D) kinetics and 3D T/H codes which have been, or are being developed around the world. Using various Test Reactor Isotope General Atomic (TRIGA) reactor core configurations at the Penn State Breazeale Reactor (PSBR), it is possible to determine the level of neutronics modeling required to describe kinetics and T/H feedback interactions. This research demonstrates that the small compact PSBR TRIGA core does not necessarily behave as a point kinetics reactor, but that this TRIGA can provide actual test results for 3D kinetics code benchmark efforts. This research focused on developing in-reactor tests that exhibited 3D neutronics effects coupled with 3D T/H feedback. A variety of pulses were used to evaluate the level of kinetics modeling needed for prompt temperature feedback in the fuel. Ramps and square waves were used to evaluate the detail of modeling needed for the delayed T/H feedback of the coolant. A stepped ramp was performed to evaluate and verify the derived thermal constants for the specific PSBR TRIGA core loading pattern. As part of the analytical benchmark research, the STAR 3D kinetics code (Weader, 1992, STAR: Space and time analysis of reactors, Version 5, Level 3, Users Guide, Yankee Atomic Electric Company, YEAC 1758, Bolton, MA) was used to model the transient experiments. The STAR models were coupled with the one-dimensional (1D) WIGL and LRA and 3D COBRA (Rowe, 1973, COBRA IIIC: A digital computer program for steady-state and transient thermal-hydraulic analysis of rod bundle nuclear fuel elements, Battelle Institute, Richland, WA). T/H models to determine the level of T/H modeling required to accurately describe the behaviour of the PSBR TRIGA core during these transient conditions. STAR's 1D T/H models (WIGL and LRA) were adequate for the rapid pulse events, when accurate temperature-dependent fuel thermal constants were used and the reactor coolant feedback mechanism was small. However, the longer transients (i.e. ramps, square waves) necessitated the use of the COBRA 3D fluid flow analysis coupled with the 3D STAR kinetics model.},

	abstract = {The neutron kinetics of the molten salt reactor is significantly influenced by the fuel salt flow, which leads to the analysis methods for the conventional reactors using solid fuels not being applicable for the molten salt reactors. In this study, a neutron kinetic model considering the fuel salt flow is established based on the neutron diffusion theory, which consists of two-group neutron diffusion equations for the fast and thermal neutron fluxes and six-group balance equations for delayed neutron precursors. The temperature feedback on the neutron kinetics is considered by introducing a heat transfer model in the~core, in which the group constants which are dependent on the temperature are calculated by the code DRAGON. The mathematical equations are discretized and numerically calculated by developing a code, in which the fully implicit scheme is adopted for the time-dependent terms, and the power law scheme is for the convection{\textendash}diffusion terms. The neutron kinetics is conducted during three transient conditions including the rods drop transient, the pump coastdown transient and the inlet temperature drop transient. The relative power changes and the distributions of the temperature, neutron fluxes and delayed neutron precursors under these three different transient conditions are obtained in the study. The results provide some valuable information for the research and design of this new generation reactor.},

Due to this, and the introduction of some further limiting cases, the chapter offers substantial insight into and understanding of the physics and the neutronic behavior of molten salt systems with circulating fuel. After a discussion of the properties of the model and the limiting cases for the static equations, a treatment of space{\textendash}time transients is introduced, and some limiting cases are solved explicitly. Thereafter the kinetic and dynamic response of the reactor is derived by calculating the space{\textendash}frequency-dependent neutron fluctuations (neutron noise) induced by small stationary perturbations of the system parameters. The validity of the point kinetic approximation and the calculation of the point kinetic component of the noise are discussed. Finally, the neutron noise induced by various perturbations propagating with the circulating fuel is calculated and discussed.},

The measurements recorded flux at several detector locations outside the core while reactivity insertions of varying scale were conducted. The results provide valuable data to explore point and 3D reactor models. Inverse point-kinetics analyses of the recorded flux indicate that delayed parameters tabulated by only the fission-rate per nuclide provide similar results to adjoint-weighted kinetics parameters calculated by MCNP6 via the iterated fission probability method, on the timescale of delayed neutrons. However, the inadequacy of the conventional delayed photoneutron parameters, which are based on measurements of uranium-235 in D2O, is clearly shown in the computed reactivity. The importance of delayed photoneutrons in heavy water reactor kinetics necessitates an improved understanding of the delayed photoneutron group structure by nuclide and appropriate adjoint-weighting for photoneutrons.},

	abstract = {There is no one model can describe the neutron point kinetic formulation of reactor behaviors. This is due to that nuclear reactor operates in different time regions under different conditions. Therefore, we investigated in this paper several models to explain the performance of neutron point kinetic reactors according to time region of operation. These regions of operation represent the prompt neutron analysis, the delayed supercritical assessment and the transient behavior analysis. The first region of operation is described by neutron jump approximation model. The delayed supercritical one is evaluated by substitution model and combinational analysis model. The transient behavior includes prompt and delayed temperature feedback models. The obtained results are compared with published numerical models and validated using block diagram programming technique. The effects of initial power on the reactor performance are evaluated. Moreover, the influences of inserted positive and negative reactivity on the generated neutron flux density are introduced. The steady state operation of nuclear reactor is improved after step reactivity of $\rho$0 \&gt; 1$\beta$. It is observed that the behavior of delayed neutron precursor increases after 40 s from cold start-up mode. Furthermore, optimum reactivity with step reactivity of $\rho$ = 2$\beta$ is accomplished that introduces efficient handling of control rod within reactor core. Hence, the neutron dynamic behaviors under variation of control rod positions can be estimated. Thus, safety analysis and transient behaviors during start-up and shutdown of nuclear power plants can be optimized. Consequently, efficient nuclear protection level of nuclear power plant can be fulfilled.},

	abstract = {This textbook presents the theory and methods of prediction that are the heart of nuclear reactor safety. Time-dependent reactor behavior is explained in both mathematical and physical terms. This book also explains the logic behind the working formulas and calculational methods for reactor transients and illustrates typical dynamic responses. The classical concept of point kinetics is developed in three steps, with discussion of various solutions to kinetics problems. Each chapter includes homework problems and review questions.},

	isbn = {978-0-89448-453-7},
	abstract = {Bridging the gap between the view of the reactor physicist and that of the control engineer, this text gives particular attention to lumped-parameter dynamic equations, or the point-reactor model, though careful attention is paid to the derivation of this model from neutron diffusion and transport theory. The reader is brought up to date in the field of space-dependent effects, and the dynamics of large reactors, pulsed neutron techniques, and a brief introduction to neutron waves are included as examples.
