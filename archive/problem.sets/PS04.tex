\question{
	This problem deals with the following differential equation:
 $$\displaystyle \frac{d u(t)}{d t} = \lambda\left(u(t)-cos(t)\right)-sin(t),\; u(t_o) = \eta$$
The analytical solution to this differential equation given by:
 $$\displaystyle u(t) = e^{\lambda\;(t-t_o)}(\eta-cos(t_o))+cos(t)$$
