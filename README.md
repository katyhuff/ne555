Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering 560: Nuclear Reactor Kinetics and Dynamics

- Diffusion and transport neutron balances with delayed neutrons;
- formal development of the point reactor kinetics equations;
- analytic and numerical solutions of the point reactor kinetics equations; 
- space-dependent, multigroup reactor kinetics; reactivity measurements; 
- reactor noise analysis; 
- advanced topics.


This material has been assembled from a variety of sources. One important 
source is the NE555 material developed by Lewis Lloyd at the University of 
Wisconsin. That work was developed under a CC-By licence, as is this derivative 
work.
